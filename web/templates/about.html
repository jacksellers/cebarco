            <h5><b>Introduction</b></h5>
            <p>
                Cebarco (Civil Engineering, Building and Construction) was founded in 1992 by Khalid Abdulrahim.
                We form the focal point of the KAR Group and provide our clients with unparalleled managerial,
                technical and engineering services. As a Grade AA contractor (certified by the Bahrain Ministry of Work,
                Municipalities Affairs & Urban Planning), Cebarco is considered to be part of the local construction elite.
                Clients can take comfort in our commitment to the quality, health, safety and environmental issues
                surrounding all of our projects.

                As Bahrain has grown into a thriving 21st century economy, Cebarco has grown with it, taking on
                some of the nation's biggest projects along the way. These include the
                Bahrain International Circuit, City Centre Bahrain, Isa Cultural Centre and New Exhibition & Convention Centre.
                Completing the racing circuit in just 16 months (6 weeks ahead of schedule) paved the way for Bahrain's
                first ever Formula One grand prix in 2004 and established Cebarco's reputation for building world class
                motorsports venues. This led to us being awarded contracts for both the Bahrain International Karting
                Circuit and the Yas Marina Circuit.<br><br>
                Cebarco has a wealth of expertise encompassing most forms of hotels, commercial, retail, sports facilities,
                military, and residential building construction as well as significant infrastructure projects such as
                data centres, roads, bridges, substations, and sewage treatment plants.
                Our headquarters is in the Kingdom of Bahrain with operations also in Cyprus and the UAE.
